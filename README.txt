CL-STRFTIME is a Common Lisp compiler for the strftime “language.”

FORMAT-TIME takes four arguments: a stream, a strftime-style control
string, a time (defaults to now), and a time zone (defaults to here).

     (cl-strftime:format-time t "%D" (get-universal-time))
     => 02/12/12

The stream argument may be NIL or T, as for FORMAT.

The time argument may be a universal time or a LOCAL-TIME timestamp.

The time zone should be NIL, for here; T, for UTC; or a time zone
object in LOCAL-TIME'S format.

The other exported function, MAKE-TIME-FORMATTER, is to FORMAT-TIME as
FORMATTER is to FORMAT.

FORMAT-TIME also understands a number of named formats. To use a named
format, pass a keyword in place of the control string.

     (cl-strftime:format-time t :rfc-3339 (get-universal-time))
     => 2012-03-19T06:16:29Z

FORMAT-TIME understands the following flags and directives:

FLAGS

- Do not pad
_ Pad with spaces
0 Pad with zeros
# Toggle case
^ Upcase

CL-STRFTIME goes to great lengths to be compatible with strftime. In
fact it uses generative testing to ensure its results match those
generated by `date`.
