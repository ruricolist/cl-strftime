CL-STRFTIME is a Common Lisp compiler for the strftime language. It is
not an interface to a foreign function, but a re-implementation from
scratch.

FORMAT-TIME takes four arguments: a stream, a strftime-style control
string, a time (defaults to now), and a time zone (defaults to here).

     (cl-strftime:format-time t "%D" (get-universal-time))
     => 02/12/12

The time argument may be a universal time or a LOCAL-TIME timestamp.
The time zone should be NIL, for here; T, for UTC; or a time zone
object in LOCAL-TIME'S format.

The second exported function, MAKE-TIME-FORMATTER, is to FORMAT-TIME
as FORMATTER is to FORMAT.

As an extension, FORMAT-TIME understands a number of named formats. To
use a named format, pass a keyword in place of the control string.

     (cl-strftime:format-time t :rfc-3339 (get-universal-time))
     => 2012-03-19T06:16:29Z

FORMAT-TIME understands the following flags and directives:

FLAGS

- Do not pad
_ Pad with spaces
0 Pad with zeros
# Toggle case
^ Upcase

Depends on CL-PPCRE, DATE-CALC, and LOCAL-TIME, which are
Quicklisp-installable.
